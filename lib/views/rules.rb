  puts "- A dealer card is dealt face down, your card is dealt face up. You must decide whether the dealer's card is higher or lower than your card. If you play 15 rounds, the deck is reshuffled." 
  puts "- Aces are the highest cards, twos are the lowest. If the same number is drawn, suits are used to judge which card is higher. Suits in order of high to low are spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds."
  puts "See if you can get on the scoreboard by getting a long streak or winning the most money!"
